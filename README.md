### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm GenAI Solution Architect / Practitioner Manager. With over 12 years of experience blending data science, GenAI, and agentic AI systems, Iâ€™ve architected scalable, cloud-native AI solutions that drive measurable business outcomes. Most recently at Accenture, I led the delivery of GenAI-powered marketing and sales toolsâ€”boosting campaign ROI by up to 35% and automating insight generation across enterprise dashboards using Gemini and Vertex AI.

My hands-on expertise spans LangChain, AutoGen, and OpenAI APIs, coupled with deep knowledge in NLP, CV, and real-time recommendation systems. Iâ€™ve led high-impact teams of 20+ professionals, built frameworks like Consumer360 and SocialAI, and mentored 1900+ learners as part of my commitment to AI leadership.

Iâ€™m passionate about building intelligent, agentic systems that are not just innovativeâ€”but deeply practical and impactful. Iâ€™d welcome the opportunity to bring this mindset to your team.
