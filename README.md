### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on building AI Core computer vision based projects using pytorch framework.

I had developed quite a number AI projects including some major projects Chest x-ray report Generation, Phenomonia bounding box prediction, COVID-19 chest x-ray image classfication, Blood Pressure Prediction using PPG signals.

I'm currently learning 

I can help collaborating with industries who need consulting on building Computer Vision based projects.

3. A step-by-step way to build the best deep learning network architectures with one variable change approach in an efficient way.
4. Receptive Fields - The CORE fundamental concept behind computer vision to design an efficient network.
5. Batch Normalization, Kernels & Regularization and Mathematics behind them
6. Backpropagation and Advanced Convolutions - Depthwise, Pixel Shuffle, Dilated, Transpose convolution.
7. Advanced Image Augmentation Techniques - Albumentations, Richman's data augmentation, and benchmarks
8. DNN Interpretability - Class Activation Maps, the most powerful debugging tool at your disposal
9. SuperConvergence: Cyclic Learning Rates, One Cycle Policy
10. ResNets: Trained ResNet for TinyImageNet from scratch
11. YoloV2/YoloV3: Understanding YOLOV2/V3 Loss Function, Implementing Object Detection Training & Transfer Learning on Custom Objects from scratch (Pipeline - Data Collection, Annotating, Data Pre-processing, Image augmentation, Customizing the YOLO architecture as per the need, Model training, Model inference [Extract the frames of the video, Inference the objects in the frames, stitch the frames back to form video along with Audio])
12. Advanced Training Concepts - Optimizers, LR Schedules, & Loss Functions
13. The intuition behind state of art networks VGG16/VGG19, ResNets, Inception, RCNN family (RCNN, Fast-RCNN, FasterRCNN), YOLO v1/v2/v3, and Squeeze & Excitation network.
14. Sequence Models - RNNs, LSTMs/GRUs, and Bidirectional & Attention-based LSTMs/GRUs.
15. Image Captioning - Image Captioning - Integrating CNN + LSTMs
16. Monocular Depth Estimation and 3D plane surface prediction from 2D data which can be used in VR, AR, and Autonomous driving.
